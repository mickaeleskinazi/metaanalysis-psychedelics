\section{Results}

\subsection{Study selection}
Screening identified controlled trials of MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, and ayahuasca that reported adverse events in at least one acute \emph{session} window and/or a subsequent \emph{follow-up} window. Details of eligibility and reference-arm selection are described in Methods.

\subsection{Study characteristics}
Across molecules, trials included one to six active dose tiers and an inactive placebo (when available). Adverse events (AEs) were harmonised to a shared vocabulary (\texttt{ae\_term}) and analysed by time window (session vs follow-up). A compact summary per molecule, including significance counts, is provided in \Cref{tab:topline-summary}.

    \label{tab:topline-summary}
    \input{tables/compare_topline_molecule.tex}
  \end{table}
}{}

\subsection{Primary synthesis of adverse events}
Random-effects pooling showed molecule-specific AE profiles during the acute session, with markedly fewer signals at follow-up. Per-molecule aggregate statistics (including $k$, $I^2$, $\tau^2$, and overall p-values) are shown in \Cref{tab:overall-by-molecule}.

  \end{figure}

\subsection{Temporal distribution (session vs follow-up)}
Session versus follow-up comparisons per molecule appear in \Cref{tab:agg-mol-window}. As expected for acute psychedelic effects, the majority of signals concentrate in the session window, with limited persistence at follow-up.

\subsection{Per-adverse-event findings}
Harmonised per-AE models (by molecule and window) are compactly reported in \Cref{tab:per-ae-molecule}. We recommend using this table for the main-text narrative (highlighting which AEs are significant and when), with full per-AE breakdowns in the Supplement if needed.

  \end{figure}

\subsection{Sensitivity and heterogeneity}
Where available, leave-one-out analyses did not materially alter directionality. Heterogeneity varied by molecule and AE; estimates are reported in \Cref{tab:overall-by-molecule} and \Cref{tab:agg-mol-window}. Funnel or Egger testing was only considered when $k \ge 10$.
