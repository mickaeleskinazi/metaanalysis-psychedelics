\subsection{Results}

Global dose--response analyses indicated that LSD (Q$_M$ = 11.36, $p = 7.49\times10^{-4}$), MDMA (Q$_M$ = 15.22, $p = 1.07\times10^{-6}$), and psilocybin (Q$_M$ = 19.13, $p = 3.94\times10^{-11}$) exhibited significant session-level slopes (Table~\ref{tab:dr-global-session}). Ayahuasca could not be evaluated because only a single dosing condition was available. Across molecules, the fitted curves suggested monotonic dose increases with mild deviations from linearity (Figure~\ref{fig:dr-global-session}).

Only a subset of adverse events displayed session dose sensitivity for each molecule (Figure~\ref{fig:dr-by-ae-session}). Headache, nausea, and illusions increased with LSD exposure; MDMA amplified nausea, headache, dizziness, and fatigue; and psilocybin was associated with higher rates of fatigue and hypertension (Table~\ref{tab:dr-ae-by-molecule-session}).

Session-to-follow-up forest comparisons confirmed that psilocybin and ayahuasca were only estimable during dosing sessions, whereas LSD and MDMA had additional follow-up panels (Figure~\ref{fig:forest-combined}). All significant AE signals were transient: LSD showed session-limited elevations in nausea, headache, and illusions; MDMA effects on nausea, dizziness, headache, and fatigue faded after dosing; and psilocybin produced session-only hypertension and fatigue (Table~\ref{tab:forest-ae-by-window}). The tally of transient versus persistent or emergent signals is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:forest-ae-sig-counts}.
