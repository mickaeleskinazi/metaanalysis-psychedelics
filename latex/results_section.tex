\subsection{Descriptive characteristics of included studies}

Across the 26 eligible trials, we identified four distinct molecules—LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, and ayahuasca—covering a total of approximately 773 participants and 61 unique study arms. Table~\ref{tab:study_summary_wide} summarizes the main design features and data availability for each compound.

Psilocybin accounted for the largest number of participants (\(n=300\)) and studies (\(k=8\)), followed by MDMA (\(n=215,\;k=10\)) and LSD (\(n=234,\;k=6\)), while ayahuasca was the least represented (\(n=24,\;k=2\)). 
The number of contrasts contributing to meta-analysis was correspondingly greater for LSD (\(k_{\text{session}}=149;\;k_{\text{follow-up}}=108\)), MDMA (\(k_{\text{session}}=160;\;k_{\text{follow-up}}=58\)), and psilocybin (\(k_{\text{session}}=162;\;k_{\text{follow-up}}=—\)), whereas ayahuasca yielded a single-dose dataset (\(k_{\text{session}}=16\)) with no follow-up information. 

Active dose ranges varied substantially between molecules, reflecting differences in pharmacological potency and dosing conventions: LSD doses spanned 0.1–200 µg, psilocybin 10–40 mg, MDMA 75–150 mg, and ayahuasca a fixed preparation corresponding to roughly 0.36 mg of active alkaloids. 
LSD and MDMA both included multiple dose levels per study, supporting continuous dose–response modeling, whereas psilocybin trials typically employed two to three fixed doses and ayahuasca trials used a single standardized dose.

All molecules had well-defined placebo controls, but their nature differed. 
Inactive placebos (e.g., lactose, mannitol, saline) were used in roughly half of the LSD and psilocybin studies and in most ayahuasca trials, whereas active, non-psychedelic placebos such as niacin were more common in MDMA and LSD studies. 
Some psilocybin trials also employed very-low-dose comparators as quasi-active placebos. 
This heterogeneity in placebo strategy reflects efforts to maintain blinding across drug classes with highly distinguishable subjective effects.

Regarding temporal coverage, only LSD and MDMA trials systematically reported AEs at both the dosing session and follow-up visits, enabling within-molecule comparison of acute versus post-acute safety. 
Psilocybin and ayahuasca datasets contained exclusively session-phase data, precluding longitudinal analysis but offering rich acute AE detail. 
The number of unique AE terms was highest for psilocybin (96 during session), followed by MDMA (70) and LSD (62), whereas ayahuasca contributed a smaller but consistent set (12).

Overall, this descriptive synthesis shows that the evidence base is uneven but adequate for comparative modeling: LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin provide sufficient dose and time-window diversity to support both dose–response and forest analyses, while ayahuasca data remain limited to low-dose, session-only outcomes. 
The mix of inactive and active placebos across molecules underlines differences in trial design, which are considered when interpreting heterogeneity in subsequent models.

\subsection{Dose–response analyses during the session}

\paragraph{Global dose–response by molecule.}
Across the acute session, all three molecules with sufficient dose variation showed a clear overall dose–response for adverse events (AEs). Meta-regression omnibus tests for dose (linear or spline) were significant for LSD ($p=7.49\times10^{-4}$), MDMA ($p=1.07\times10^{-6}$), and psilocybin ($p=3.94\times10^{-11}$), indicating that higher doses were associated with higher AE burden at the session level (Table~\ref{tab:dr-global-by-molecule}). Visual inspection of the global curves (Fig.~\ref{fig:dr-global-session}) shows a steeper overall rise for psilocybin, a robust increase for MDMA that is close to linear over the studied range, and a non-linear shape for LSD consistent with a marked increase at the upper end of its tested doses.

\paragraph{Dose–response by specific adverse event (AE).}
We next examined the dose–response at the AE level using session-only models, isolating which adverse events showed a statistically significant relationship with dose for each molecule.  
Figure~\ref{fig:dr-by-ae-session} illustrates the modeled curves (log-odds ratio vs.\ dose) for all AEs, with significant dose terms flagged by stars ($p<0.05$).  
Only a subset of AEs demonstrated clear dose sensitivity, highlighting those adverse effects whose risk scales directly with dosage.  

For \textbf{LSD}, several AEs exhibited highly significant dose–response effects. The strongest were \textit{dizziness} ($p=3.2\times10^{-4}$), \textit{attention disturbance} ($p=0.001$), and \textit{visual hallucination/illusion} ($p<0.001$), each showing a steep monotonic increase with dose.  
Somatic effects such as \textit{headache} ($p=0.014$) and \textit{nausea} ($p=0.03$) also rose significantly with increasing LSD exposure.  
The steepest slopes were observed for dizziness and visual distortions, indicating that perceptual and vestibular side-effects are the most dose-sensitive under LSD.  
Among all molecules, LSD showed the broadest spectrum of significant dose-responsive AEs, spanning both cognitive and somatic domains.

For \textbf{MDMA}, dose sensitivity was concentrated in a smaller set of physiological AEs, consistent with its stimulant pharmacology.  
Significant increases with dose were observed for \textit{jaw tension} ($p=0.002$), \textit{perspiration} ($p=0.008$), and \textit{dry mouth} ($p=0.011$), all reflecting autonomic activation.  
\textit{Anxiety} also rose significantly with higher doses ($p=0.019$), though less sharply than the somatic effects.  
The overall magnitude of the MDMA dose–AE slopes was moderate compared with LSD, indicating a more linear and less explosive escalation of side-effects with dose.  
Nevertheless, the physiological burden of MDMA (muscle tension, sweating) increased consistently across the clinical range (50–125 mg).

For \textbf{Psilocybin}, two domains showed pronounced dose dependence: \textit{fatigue/lethargy} ($p=0.003$) and \textit{hypertension or blood-pressure elevation} ($p<0.001$).  
\textit{Headache} also showed a positive but weaker dose trend ($p=0.042$).  
These effects together depict psilocybin’s acute physiological cost at higher doses — especially cardiovascular and energy-related.  
Relative to LSD and MDMA, psilocybin’s dose-response curves were steeper for physical AEs but shallower for psychological ones, suggesting that its tolerability limits are driven primarily by autonomic and somatic strain rather than perceptual distress.

Finally, \textbf{ayahuasca} yielded no statistically significant dose-response terms, owing to the limited dosing range (essentially a single standardized dose across studies).  
Nonetheless, gastrointestinal AEs such as \textit{nausea} and \textit{vomiting} were consistently frequent, aligning with clinical expectations, though dose-independent in this dataset.

In summary, LSD showed the widest spectrum of dose-sensitive AEs (both psychological and somatic), MDMA primarily exhibited dose-dependent autonomic activation, and psilocybin’s dose sensitivity centered on fatigue and hypertension.  
Across all substances, the most robust dose-AE associations (lowest p-values) were observed for LSD’s \textit{dizziness} and psilocybin’s \textit{blood-pressure elevation}, marking these as the most potent dose-linked adverse effects among the compounds studied.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Session vs.\ follow-up dose–response (molecules with longitudinal data).}
For LSD and MDMA (the molecules with follow-up AEs), Fig.~\ref{fig:dr-session-followup} overlays global dose–response at session vs.\ follow-up. As expected, LSD’s dose-linked AE burden is largely confined to the session (little residual dose effect at follow-up), whereas MDMA shows a dose-related AE burden extending into follow-up (higher doses associated with greater post-session AE incidence). This confirms that \emph{timing} matters: for some drugs the dose effect is acute; for others (MDMA) a dose-dependent residue is also visible post-session.

\subsection{Forest plots of AE incidence (drug vs.\ placebo) by time window}

\paragraph{Combined panel and molecule-level summaries.}
Figure~\ref{fig:forest-combined} shows a single combined panel of forest plots (one subpanel per molecule), with separate markers for the session and (where available) follow-up windows. This complements the dose–response view by addressing the categorical question: is a given AE significantly more frequent on drug than placebo in that window? For LSD and MDMA, we further summarize which AEs are transient (session-only), emergent (follow-up-only), or persistent (significant in both windows) using the transition table derived from the same models (Table~\ref{tab:ae-transition}).

\end{table}


\paragraph{AE incidence by time window.}
Table~\ref{tab:ae-transition} and Figure~\ref{fig:forest-combined} summarize how adverse events (AEs) evolve between the acute \textit{session} phase and the \textit{follow-up} period.  
Overall, the majority of AEs across compounds were \textbf{transient}, occurring only during the drug session and resolving by the next assessment.  
Across all molecules, we identified \textbf{14 transient}, \textbf{5 emergent}, and only \textbf{3 persistent} AEs (Table~\ref{tab:ae-transition}).  

For \textbf{LSD}, the acute session was marked by four significant transient AEs --- \textit{visual hallucination} ($p<0.001$), \textit{illusion} ($p=0.002$), \textit{nausea} ($p=0.01$), and \textit{sleep disorder} ($p=0.03$) --- all of which resolved entirely by follow-up. Three emergent AEs appeared post-session: \textit{attention disturbance} ($p=0.04$), \textit{fatigue} ($p=0.01$), and \textit{headache} ($p=0.02$).  
No persistent LSD-related AEs were observed, confirming that LSD’s adverse effects are largely acute and self-limited.

For \textbf{MDMA}, a different pattern emerged. Five session-phase AEs were significant (\textit{dizziness} $p=0.02$, \textit{headache} $p<0.01$, \textit{jaw tension} $p<0.001$, \textit{lack of appetite} $p=0.04$, and \textit{nausea} $p<0.05$), highlighting the drug’s strong sympathomimetic and serotonergic activation.  
While these effects diminished after the session, three additional AEs became significant only at follow-up --- most notably \textit{fatigue} ($p<0.01$), \textit{sleep disturbance} ($p=0.03$), and \textit{anxiety} ($p<0.001$) --- suggesting delayed “comedown” phenomena.  
Importantly, three MDMA AEs (\textit{anxiety}, \textit{fatigue}, and \textit{sleep disorder}) remained significant in both windows, qualifying as \textbf{persistent} side effects that bridged the acute and post-acute phases.  
This temporal pattern underscores MDMA’s dual profile: transient physical effects during intoxication and lingering mood or energy disturbances afterward.

For \textbf{psilocybin}, seven AEs reached significance during the session: \textit{depressed mood}, \textit{euphoric mood}, \textit{headache}, \textit{illusion}, \textit{mood alteration}, \textit{paresthesia}, and \textit{restlessness} (all $p<0.05$).  
No follow-up data were available for psilocybin, preventing classification of emergent or persistent AEs, but the pattern suggests that its adverse effects are primarily transient and closely tied to the acute pharmacological action.

Finally, \textbf{ayahuasca} showed no statistically significant AEs after correction for multiple comparisons, likely reflecting the limited sample size and narrow dosing range. Nevertheless, trends toward gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, vomiting) were evident in raw incidence rates, consistent with the known pharmacological profile of the brew.

In summary, the temporal distribution of significant AEs reveals that LSD and psilocybin primarily induce short-lived, session-bound effects, whereas MDMA uniquely exhibits both transient physiological and delayed psychological adverse events.  
This distinction emphasizes the need for continued post-session monitoring in MDMA-assisted therapies, even when acute tolerability appears satisfactory.


\subsection{Why dose–response AE significance and forest (OR) significance may differ}

It is common for a given AE to be \emph{dose-sensitive} in the session (significant non-intercept dose term) yet not appear strongly significant in the pooled drug-vs-placebo comparison, and vice versa. Three practical mechanisms explain these discrepancies:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Threshold vs.\ gradient effects.} Some AEs turn on at low–moderate doses (so drug\,>\,placebo overall), but additional dose increases do not raise their frequency much; these yield significant forest ORs without a pronounced dose gradient.
  \item \textbf{High-dose concentration.} Other AEs occur mainly at the top dose(s). The dose–response test detects the gradient, but when all doses are pooled together, the overall drug\,vs\,placebo contrast is diluted by the low-dose arms and may not reach significance.
  \item \textbf{Window specificity.} Dose sensitivity can be visible in one window (e.g., session) while the categorical drug effect is stronger in another (e.g., follow-up). Comparing session vs.\ follow-up curves (Fig.~\ref{fig:dr-session-followup}) with forest ORs (Fig.~\ref{fig:forest-combined}) helps localize such timing effects.
\end{enumerate}

In practice, both views are complementary: dose–response tells \emph{how risk scales with dose}; forest ORs tell \emph{whether risk is elevated on drug vs.\ placebo in a given window}. We therefore report both throughout.
