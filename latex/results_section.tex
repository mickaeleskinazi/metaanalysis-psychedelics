\subsection{Results}

Global dose--response analyses indicated significant session-level slopes for LSD ($Q_M = 11.36$, $p = 7.49\times10^{-4}$), MDMA ($Q_M = 21.10$, $p = 3.73\times10^{-10}$), and psilocybin ($Q_M = 19.13$, $p = 3.94\times10^{-11}$) (Table~\ref{tab:dr-global-session}). Ayahuasca could not be evaluated because only a single dosing condition was available. LSD retained a significant follow-up slope ($p = 2.35\times10^{-3}$; $k = 108$ contrasts), MDMA follow-up slopes were not significant ($p = 5.65\times10^{-2}$), and psilocybin had no evaluable follow-up contrasts. Fitted curves suggested monotonic dose increases with mild deviations from linearity (Figure~\ref{fig:dr-global-session}).

Session adverse-event analyses showed that LSD (nausea [$p = 3.17\times10^{-3}$], headache [$p = 1.04\times10^{-2}$], illusion [$p = 4.94\times10^{-2}$]), MDMA (headache [$p = 2.24\times10^{-2}$], nausea [$p = 3.30\times10^{-2}$], fatigue [$p = 4.57\times10^{-2}$], dizziness [$p = 4.87\times10^{-2}$]), and psilocybin (fatigue [$p = 2.54\times10^{-6}$], hypertension [$p = 4.07\times10^{-3}$]) exhibited dose-sensitive increases (Figure~\ref{fig:dr-by-ae-session}; Table~\ref{tab:dr-ae-by-molecule-session}).

Forest comparisons (Figure~\ref{fig:forest-combined}) indicated that psilocybin and ayahuasca were only estimable during dosing sessions, whereas LSD and MDMA contributed both session and follow-up panels. All significant AE signals were transient with no persistent or emergent effects: LSD showed session-limited elevations in nausea, headache, and illusion; MDMA elevations in dizziness, fatigue, headache, and nausea dissipated by follow-up; and psilocybin produced session-only hypertension and fatigue (Table~\ref{tab:forest-ae-by-window}). The tally of transient versus persistent or emergent signals is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:forest-ae-sig-counts}.
